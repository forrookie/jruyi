Usage: obr:deploy <bundle-name | bundle-symbolic-name>[@<version>] | <bundle-id> ...

Tries to install or update the specified bundles and all of their dependencies
by default.  Either the bundle name/symbolic-name or the bundle identifier can
be specified.  If a bundle's name contains spaces, then it must be surrounded
by quotes.  It is also possible to specify a precise version if more than one
version exists.
